# Version 0.2.2

* Fixes bug that could cause a failure to locate an already-installed
  version of ExifTool on MacOS (and possibly also on *NIX
  OS's). Thanks to Courtney Meier for the bug report.

# Version 0.2.0

* Changes default location into which exiftool executable is
  downloaded by a call to `install_exiftool()`. Formerly, the
  executable was installed into the directory returned by
  `system.file("exiftool", package = "exiftoolr")`, which will not
  always be writable (as, e.g., when the package is installed by an
  admin in the shared library of a multi-user server, and hence is
  owned by "root"). Now, the executable is by default installed to the
  directory given by `backports::R_user_dir()`, which should be more
  generally writable.

# Version 0.1.8

* Fixes an issue that caused `configure_exiftoolr()` (and thus
  essentially all **exiftoolr** functionality) to fail on Windows
  machines that do not have Perl installed in a location findable by
  the `exiftoolr:::configure_perl()`. Thanks to Tom Yamashita for
  reporting this issue.
  
* Adds tests (using the **tinytest** package).

# Version 0.1.7

* Fixes an issue that could cause `configure_exiftoolr()` to fail if
  the path to the ExifTool executable on a user's computer contained
  any spaces. Now `configure_exiftoolr()` should work even if there
  are spaces in the path(s) to the user's installation of Perl and/or
  their ExifTool executable or library. Thanks to Lafont Rapnouil
  Tristan for reporting the issue.

# Version 0.1.6

* Fixes a problem likely to affect Linux users (but also any others
  relying on a local installation of Perl to execute calls to
  ExifTool), caused by the internal change in `exif_call()` in 0.1.5
  from `system()` to `system2()`. Thanks to Daniel Baumgartner for
  bringing this to my attention.

# Version 0.1.5

* Added a `pipeline` option to `exif_read()`, which allows users to
  direct the exif executable to output results in csv rather than json
  format. This is helpful for use with images whose metadata contains
  non-UTF-8-encoded characters. As is documented
  [here](https://exiftool.org/exiftool_pod.html#Input-output-text-formatting),
  ExifTool's JSON output does not properly handle non-UTF-8 character
  sets. Setting `pipeline="csv"` ensures that non-UTF-8 character sets
  **are** properly handled, as demonstrated in a new example in `?exif_read`.

# Version 0.1.4

* Fixed `exif_read()` to now allow repeated elements in `args=`. This
  can be necessary when (to take one example) a user needs to
  separately specify the encoding used in the image file names and in
  the tags respectively. Now, a call like the following works as it
  should:
  
      exif_read(path = "myimage.jpg", 
	            args = c("-charset", "exiftool=cp850", "-charset", "filename=cp1250"))

# Version 0.1.1

* Failure of `configure_exiftoolr()` to find a local installation of
  ExifTool now throws an error rather than just a warning, preventing
  infinite recursion by `exif_read()` and `exif_version()`.
